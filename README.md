# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This command-line application is tailor-made for web developers, especially those who need a rapid and efficient method for generating logos for their projects without the necessity of graphic designers. With this tool, logos can be tailored in shape, color, and text and then saved as an SVG file.

- **Problem Solved**: Offers a swift method to generate SVG logos based on direct user input from the command line.

- **Learnings**: Diving deep into node.js, exploring SVG generation, crafting CLI tools, and refining user input to create an intuitive user experience.
